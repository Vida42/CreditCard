This solution includes three folders: src, test and res.

- All the code in `src/`

- All the tests(using `JUnit`) in `test/`

- In order to make the application easier to run, a `JAR` file in `res/`

You can find required test cases in `CreditCard/test/PersonTest.java` with name `testCustomised1`, `testCustomised2` and `testCustomised3`.
